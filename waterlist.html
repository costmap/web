      <p class="title">Why Is Water Important?
        <p>
          <p class="subTitle">
            It’s common to hear that water is essential for your health. But why?
            This substance makes up a majority of your body weight and is involved in many important functions,
            including:
            flushing out waste from your body
            regulating body temperature
            helping your brain function
            See details to learn more ways water can help improve your well-being.

      <p class="title">How much should you drink every day？
        <p>
          <p class="subTitle">The big question is how much water do you need to drink every day? Although that's a
            simple question, it
            doesn't have an easy answer. It depends on some environmental and physical factors that can change every
            day. Also, it's not just the water you drink—about 20 percent of your water intake comes from the foods you
            eat. The remaining 80 percent comes from beverages, including water, coffee, tea, milk, and anything liquid.

      <p class="title">When Do You Need to Drink More Water?
      </p>
      <p class="subTitle">Most people can gauge their water intake by looking at urine color. If you're getting enough
        water, your urine
        will be pale yellow, and you'll urinate several times a day. Urine color doesn't work for everyone. Taking
        dietary supplements that contain riboflavin will make your urine bright yellow, and certain medications can
        change the color of your urine, as well. And if you have any kidney problems or other health conditions you
        should talk to your health care provider about how much water to drink.</p>

      <p class="title">What Happens to Your Body When You Stop Drinking Water？
      </p>
      <p class="subTitle">When you don't drink enough water, your energy drops and your mood becomes more irritable. A
        dehydrated brain
        actually works much harder to achieve simple tasks, than when you are well hydrated. It even temporarily shrinks
        if you don't drink water.</p>
