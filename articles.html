            <p>The big question is how much water do you need to drink every day? Although that's a simple question, it
              doesn't have an easy answer. It depends on some environmental and physical factors that can change every
              day. Also, it's not just the water you drinkâ€”about 20 percent of your water intake comes from the foods
              you eat. The remaining 80 percent comes from beverages, including water, coffee, tea, milk, and
              anything liquid.</p>

            <p>Most people can gauge their water intake by looking at urine color. If you're getting enough water, your
              urine will be pale yellow, and you'll urinate several times a day. Urine color&nbsp;doesn't work for
              everyone. Taking dietary supplements that contain&nbsp;riboflavin&nbsp;will make your urine bright yellow, and certain medications can
              change the color of your urine,&nbsp;as well. And if you have any kidney problems or other health
              conditions you should talk to your health care provider about how much water to drink.</p>

            <p>Thirst is the desire to drink something. It can be triggered by the loss of fluid volume in and around

              breath is accompanied by a dry mouth, drinking more water throughout the day may help. Keep a glass of
              water by your bedside for nighttime relief, too.</p>

              But it's not clear what happens if you consume lots of caffeine without the fluid. There's probably some
              potential for dehydration if you're gulping down energy
