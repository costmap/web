            <p>The big question is how much water do you need to drink every day? Although that's a simple question, it
              doesn't have an easy answer. It depends on some environmental and physical factors that can change every
              day. Also, it's not just the water you drink—about 20 percent of your water intake comes from the foods
              you eat. The remaining 80 percent comes from beverages, including water, coffee, tea, milk, and
              anything liquid.</p>

            <p>Most people can gauge their water intake by looking at urine color. If you're getting enough water, your
              urine will be pale yellow, and you'll urinate several times a day. Urine color&nbsp;doesn't work for
              everyone. Taking dietary supplements that contain&nbsp;riboflavin&nbsp;will make your urine bright yellow, and certain medications can
              change the color of your urine,&nbsp;as well. And if you have any kidney problems or other health
              conditions you should talk to your health care provider about how much water to drink.</p>

            <p>Thirst is the desire to drink something. It can be triggered by the loss of fluid volume in and around

              breath is accompanied by a dry mouth, drinking more water throughout the day may help. Keep a glass of
              water by your bedside for nighttime relief, too.</p>

              But it's not clear what happens if you consume lots of caffeine without the fluid. There's probably some
              potential for dehydration if you're gulping down energy
