<h2>  You gain water weight</h2>
<p>It sounds counterintuitive, but skimping on drinking water can actually cause water retention and temporary weight gain. </p>

<h2>  Your energy drops</h2>  
<p>You should drink plenty of water during the day to stay hydrated. In fact, even slight dehydration can significantly drain your energy levels.</p>

<h2>You lose focus</h2>
<p>The fundamental element of life is also essential to finding great ideas. Made of 80 percent water, your brain’s abilities and functions seriously depend on it. Even slight dehydration impairs its abilities. </p>

<h2>You get crankier</h2>
<p>Feeling cranky? Forgoing H2O may be the worst thing you could do. Two studies from the University of Connecticut put men and women through a series of cognitive tests and found that even being mildly dehydrated affected their moods and caused fatigue and headaches.</p>

<h2>You feel hungrier</h2>
<p>It’s very common to confuse hunger with dehydration. If your stomach is growling, your best bet is to drink some water.</p>

<h2>Your skin worsens</h2>
<p>Water helps to plump up your skin, so you should be able to imagine what dehydration will do. When you don’t drink enough water, the collagen begins to crack and bind together, causing fine lines and wrinkles to get more noticed. We rely on water to keep our insides sufficiently hydrated, too. So when you ditch it, expect your mouth, skin, and everything else to feel drier than normal.</p>

<h2>Your workout performance suffers</h2>
<p>Your body cannot efficiently convert carbs into energy without ample water. And according to The Physiological Society, dehydration can lead to poor exercise performance. Not only will your workout sessions suffer but insufficient liquids in your body will also hold back the breakdown of fat.</p>
